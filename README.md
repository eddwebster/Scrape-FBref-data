# Scrape FBref data

This repository is to scrape football data from fbref.com which is provided by StatsBomb - 
specially the recently added extensive data of the top five leagues. A lot of the intrinsic scraping code has been taken from this repository: https://github.com/chmartin/FBref_EPL

This snapshot from fbref.com indicates the recently added stats I'm talking about. You can scrape all of them from the Jupyter notebook above. Team and keeper stats are also included.
